The Services Marketplace provides users of Pivotal Web Services with self-service, on-demand provisioning of add-on services. Services can provide data persistence for applications as well as search, caching, messaging, and more. But services not only enhance applications, they can better enable development teams themselves, providing accounts on applications for continuous integration or load testing.
