<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Pivotal Web Services (PWS) no longer supports static external IP addresses. Instead, PWS uses a BOSH feature that automatically assigns public IP addresses to VMs. This feature assigns public IPs to the Diego cell VMs, which host all the app instances running on PWS. 

<p class='note warning'><strong>Note</strong>: The IP address assigned to a particular VM is ephemeral and may change at any time.</p>

You may need a list of possible source IP addresses. For example, you might need such a list to integrate your app with a log management service. 

To generate a a list of possible external IP address ranges for apps hosted on PWS, run the following `curl` command:

<pre class="terminal">
curl https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json | \
  ruby -rjson -e 'json = JSON.parse(STDIN.read); \
  puts json["prefixes"].select {|v| v["region"] \
  == "us-east-1" && v["service"] == "EC2"}.map{|v| v["ip_prefix"]}.to_json' \
  | jq .
</pre>

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: PWS is currently hosted on the <code>us-east-1</code> region.</p>
