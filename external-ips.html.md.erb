<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Pivotal Web Services no longer supports _static_ external IP addresses.

Instead, PWS uses a BOSH feature that automatically assigns public IP addresses to VMs. This feature assigns public IPs to the Diego cell VMs, which host all the app instances running on PWS. 

The IP address assigned to a particular VM is ephemeral and may change at any time. 

You can obtain a list of possible external IP address ranges for apps hosted on PWS.

For example, you might need a list of possible source IP addresses in order to integrate your app with a log management service.

If you need to obtain a range possible PWS IP addresses, then execute the following `curl` command.

<pre class="terminal">
curl https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json | \
  ruby -rjson -e 'json = JSON.parse(STDIN.read); \
  puts json["prefixes"].select {|v| v["region"] \
  == "us-east-1" && v["service"] == "EC2"}.map{|v| v["ip_prefix"]}.to_json' \
  | jq .
</pre>

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: PWS is currently hosted on the <code>us-east-1</code> region.</p>
