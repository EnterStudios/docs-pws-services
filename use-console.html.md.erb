title: Adding and Binding Services Using the PWS Developer Console
---

This topic describes using the Pivotal Web Services (PWS) Developer Console to
add and bind service instances through the Services Marketplace.
The Services Marketplace provides PWS users with self-service, on-demand
provisioning of add-on services.
For more information about specific service providers, refer to the
[Services](./services/index.html) topic.

To use a service with your application, you must access the Services
Marketplace, create and configure an instance of the service, then bind the
service instance to your application.
